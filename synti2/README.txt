Synti2 Software Synthesizer with some tool programs and examples.

Status:

  - The synth core has only one (or maybe two) changes to be done. I'm
    very close to defining synti2 complete as a synthesis engine.

  - Tool programs are still, and may always remain, incomplete, buggy
    hacks. They suffice for my current purposes. Feel free to
    implement them better ...
