These are the source codes for my Assembly Summer 2016 1k intro compo
entry. I have to emphasize that this was the only Linux platform entry
this year, and I honestly think this is one of the coolest native
Linux 1k's ever.. Finns might want to read my presentation (in
Finnish) about the fun and pain of creating tiny audiovisual wonders
on the Linux platform:

What else.. fuzzdealer.nfo is the info text file included in the entry
zip. LICENSE.txt credits some authors I've imitated. Have fun coding,
everybody!
