Fuzzdealer
==========

"Fuzzdealer" is my first 1k intro in a real demoscene competition. I'm
all like "wow, did I really do this.. yep, I guess I did.. wow
again". I hope you enjoy it too. It is a normal "Gzip dropper" that
requires SDL2 for window and audio, and OpenGL for graphics. I'll make
the source code available right after the compo at
https://yousource.it.jyu.fi/synti2/synti2/blobs/master/synti2/doc/assembly16_1k/

I must be really emotionally damaged to have made a 1k intro as a
native Linux binary. Sane people should stick to Win&crinkler and
browser platforms in which (I think) the system overhead is much
smaller.

Fuzzdealer is contributed to the Assembly Summer 2016 1k intro
compo. The rulebook of Assembly Summer 2016 has been followed and
thoroughly exploited as follows:

- The target architecture is 32 bit Linux (Live Ubuntu with default
  libraries was promised in the Compo rules - SDL2 and OpenGL, which I
  would consider quite standard, need to be installed)

- The Assembly rules dictate that the mouse cursor must be
  hidden. This is done.

- The rules don't dictate that the entry should exit properly. So I
  provide a segfault and a core dump. Illegal instruction compresses
  much better than "exit(0)" :)

- The rules don't dictate that /tmp/ should be cleared. So I leave the
  binary there as /tmp/I$$. Clean up those files yourself, if needed.

Why the name "Fuzzdealer"? Well.. as the author, I think the more
interesting part of the entry is the synth that relies heavily on a
distortion effect. I hope that the Assembly PA will really deal out
the fuzz properly as intended.


Thanks

Greetings to all wonderful dudes and dudettes out there! Thanks to the
students of the University of Jyväskylä who kept our sponsor stand
running while the "faculty guy" was fine-tuning his demoscene entry.

Special thanks to Visy for ensuring that the Linux platform worked
well at Assembly 2016 and that Fuzzdealer ran nicely on that.
