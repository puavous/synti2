Pages = {{53-67}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{This article describes a synthesis technique based on the sonification
   of the dynamic behavior of a quantum particle enclosed in an infinite
   square well. More specifically, we sonify the momentum distribution of a
   one-dimensional Gaussian bouncing wave packet model. We have chosen this
   particular case because of its relative simplicity and interesting
   dynamic behavior, which makes it suitable for a novel sonification
   mapping that can be applied to standard synthesis techniques, resulting
   in the generation of appealing sounds. In addition, this sonification
   might provide useful insight into the behavior of the quantum particle.
   In particular, this model exhibits quantum revivals, minimizes
   uncertainty, and exhibits similarities to the case of a classical
   bouncing ball. The proposed model has been implemented in real time in
   both the Max/MSP and the Pure Data environments. The algorithm is based
   on concepts of additive synthesis where each oscillator describes the
   eigenfunctions that characterize the state evolution of the wave packet.
   We also provide an analysis of the sounds produced by the model from
   both a physical and a perceptual point of view.}},
